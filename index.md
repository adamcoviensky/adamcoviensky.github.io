# Repository of Adam Coviensky's Data Science Work
##### This repository is composed of individual work, projects, and coursework from the MSc in Data Science at Columbia University


## Projects

Analyzing the supply and demand of taxis at LaGuardia Airport. Our team worked with NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission to analyze the supply and demand of taxis at LGA and produce a webapp to be used by port authority to visualize the predicted number of taxis needed at the airport for the subsequent six hours given current conditions. My main contributions were creating the ensemble model used in the web app, data cleaning and exploration, and creating the callback features of the app.

[Final Report](Capstone/FinalReport.pdf)


Creating a user interactive recommender system for GoodReads books. We created a web app for book recommendations from a dataset of 10k books and 53k users with 6 million ratings. We built a factorization machine which takes in user input on the weighting of genres from which they want to receive their recommendations. The model's learned parameters are then adjusted in real-time and new predictions are made based off the user input. My main contributinos were testing different factorization machine packages as well as my own, preprocessing the data, and creating the functions to make new predictions based on user input.

Analyzing up and coming neighbourhoods in New York City. Using census data as well as sidewalk cafe and bar licenses, we made visualizations to perform exploratory analysis on which regions in New York City are "up and coming."

## Applied Machine Learning

Predicting NYC apartment listing prices. Built a regression model to predict optimal listing prices of NYC apartments. Took survey data of over 15k samples and 80 features. I performed both manual and automatic feature selection, feature engineering, and tuned the model's hyper parameters to achieve R^2 above 0.60.
